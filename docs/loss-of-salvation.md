# Loss of Salvation

One misunderstanding about security is that you can be genuinely saved but then lose your salvation.

## Security Taught
There are direct statements in Scripture that talk about the security of those who are saved, especially in the gospel of John:

> Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again.
> The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”
(John 4:13-14)

If someone can drink from the water Jesus gives (eternal life) and then lose eternal life, then they *will* be thirsty again, contradicting Jesus' promise.

> And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day.
> For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.
> (John 6:39-40)

If salvation can be lost, then someone the Father gave Jesus will be lost, contradicting the Father's will. And someone who believed in the Son will not be raised up to eternal life on the last day.

> I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
> My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.
> (John 10:28-29)

If salvation can be lost, then the people Jesus gives eternal life might very well perish. And they can certainly be snatched out of Jesus' and and the Father's hand.

> And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. (Rom 8:30)

God's predestination of salvation means that everyone he justifies, he will glorify, with such certainty that it can be described in the past tense: they are already glorified. But if salvation can be lost, then some who are justified will not be glorified after all.

One of the strongest passages about security is Romans 8:31-39:

> What then shall we say to these things?
> If God is for us, who can be against us?
> He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?
> Who shall bring any charge against God's elect?
> It is God who justifies.
> Who is to condemn?
> Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.
> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
> Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? As it is written,
>
> “For your sake we are being killed all the day long;
> we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.”
>
> No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
> For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

If salvation can be lost, everything in this passage must be denied. We must say that although God is for us, someone can very well be against us, bring a charge against us, and condemn us. When Christ intercedes for us to be preserved, the Father denies his prayer. Something in fact can very well separate us from the love of Christ and of God.

> In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory. (Eph 1:13-14)

If salvation can be lost, then the Holy Spirit does not at all guarantee our inheritance, because we might not get that inheritance.

## Irreversible Changes
There are also many supernatural changes that happen to a person when they are saved, that Scripture never describes as being reversible.

> We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin. (Rom 6:6)

If salvation can be lost, our old self must be brought back to life. But Scripture never describes this happening.

> Likewise, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God. (Rom 7:4)

If salvation can be lost, we must be raised back to life to the Law. But Scripture never describes this happening.

> You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. (Rom 8:9)

If salvation can be lost, we must be taken back out of the Spirit, and He must no longer dwell in us. But Scripture never describes this happening.

> he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will (Eph 1:5)

If salvation can be lost, then after being adopted as God's son or daughter, we are rejected from God's family again. But Scripture never describes this happening.

> But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (Eph 2:4-5)

If salvation can be lost, then after being made alive together with Christ, we are put to death again spiritually. But Scripture never describes this happening.
