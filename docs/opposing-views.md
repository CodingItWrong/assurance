# Alternate Views

There is a view on Christian assurance of salvation that says “even though you’ve believed in Jesus, if you aren’t producing fruit, it shows that you were never really saved.”
How exactly can this be?
There are a range of different views that people who say this will take.
Each of them runs into problems Biblically, and, to attempt to prevent this, supporters will take leaps that have logical problems as well.

I’ve seen three different sub-views of this view that differ on the exact relationship between faith and works.
The differences between the views are subtle, but important.

## Faith-Plus
The “faith-plus” view says that there is a requirement for justification in addition to faith: repentance, or submission to Christ’s Lordship.
In the last few decades this is most promoted by John MacArthur’s Lordship Salvation movement.

It’s difficult to understand how the “faith-plus” view can claim to hold to “justification by faith alone.”
In this view, in no sense is faith alone: it must be accompanied by a second thing, submission to Christ’s Lordship or repentance.
As a result, this view can’t address the many verses that describe faith or belief as the only requirement for salvation.

## Faith-Including
The “faith-including" view says that faith is indeed the one and only requirement for justification, but a certain *kind* of faith: a faith that includes repentance or obedience.
The view is very similar to “faith-plus,” but because of how it defines faith, it avoids the problem of the “faith-plus” view of adding a second requirement for justification in addition to faith.

The first argument against the "faith-including" view is, again, the many verses that list belief as the only condition of salvation.
Those who hold this view would say it handles these verses, because they *are* saying that only faith is required: true faith, that includes submission to Christ's lordship.
But what matters is not that these folks can come up with a definition of "faith" that includes submission, but rather what definition of faith is used in these verses.
And in many or all of them, "belief" simply means "belief."

> "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has everlasting life." (John 6:47)
>
> What he really meant by these words—so we are told—is something like this:
>
> "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who *repents, believes, and submits totally to My will*, has everlasting life."
>
> In support of this obvious revision of the text, we are assured that all the additional ideas are contained implicitly within the word “believe.”
> If only we understood the Biblical concept of “saving faith,” it is claimed, then we would see the validity of this way of understanding Jesus’ words.

To the contrary, "belief" simply means "belief":

> Let it be clearly stated here that English words like to “believe,” or “faith” function as fully adequate equivalents to their Greek counterparts. There is not some hidden residue of meaning in the Greek words that is not conveyed by their normal English renderings.

Romans 4:4-5 takes this further, explicitly stating that works are excluded from faith:

> Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due.
> But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.

In this verse, far from allowing work to be part of true faith, work is contrasted with faith.
If you work at all, you aren’t receiving a gift but a wage. The faith that justifies is a faith that *excludes* works.
There is no way to interpret it to mean “To the one who does not work, but believes with a faith that includes a commitment to work.”

## Faith-Then
A third view avoids the problems of the first view by clarifying that the faith that justifies really is only belief in Christ apart from any commitments to work.
The fruit that is necessary for assurance comes strictly later.
God guarantees that any believer will produce that fruit, but it’s not something we add to our faith.
Because of this, on the surface there are no problems with this view as it relates to justification by faith alone.

What exactly the standard of fruit is isn’t clear, however.
Few who take this view would argue that Christians always bear fruit perfectly (never sin), so what sin is allowed before justification is brought into question?
Is it only some “larger” or “more serious” sins?
Is it recurring sins rather than one-time?
Is it only “intentional” sins?
Scripture doesn’t provide a clear answer, so proponents of this view are left to make their own decision about what is or isn’t allowed.

Whatever decision is made about how serious the sin is, this view runs into a problem with verses that describe Christians who have significant struggles with sin.
In Romans 7, Paul describes how his desire to do good wars with sin within him that makes him desire to do evil.
In a Calvinist view that I and the advocates of fruit-as-evidence share, this passage can’t refer to Paul in his unsaved state, because unregenerate people don’t desire to do good.
In Paul, 1 Corinthians 3 addresses an audience he clearly says are saved (“brethren,” “in Christ”), yet are described as being fleshly/carnal (emphasis mine):

> And I, *brethren*, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants *in Christ*.
> I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it.
> Indeed, even now you are not yet able, for you are still *fleshly*.
> For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not *fleshly*, and are you not walking like mere men?

Paul's audience is characterized by a lifestyle of not producing fruit, yet they are still saved.

Both in 1 Corinthians 3 and in other passages, writers of the epistles encourage Christians to choose to obey God.
This is presented as a genuine choice, where choosing *not* to obey is a real possibility.
But if Christians can choose to obey God or not, then Christians don’t necessarily consistently obey.

In fact, this is a key part of Paul’s epistle structure: he usually lays out the doctrine of salvation, then states that because all those things are true of the readers, therefore they should obey.
Obedience is not a condition of assurance, but instead assurance is the basis and motivation for obedience.
We obey not so we know that we’re Christians, but because we already know that we are.

It’s important to acknowledge that the Bible *does* in fact state that all Christians will produce fruit.
Martin Luther and Charles Ryrie, both of whom are strong opponents of the idea of basing your assurance on fruit, nonetheless acknowledge the Biblical teaching that all Christians will produce fruit.
How can these views be compatible?
Because the fruit isn’t intended to be something we are guaranteed to be able to see or identify.
Ryrie writes:

> my understanding of what fruit is and therefore what I expect others to bear may be faulty and/or incomplete. It is all too easy to have a mental list of spiritual fruit and to conclude that if someone does not produce what is on my list that he or she is not a believer. But the reality is that most lists that we humans devise are too short, too selective, too prejudiced, and often extrabiblical. God likely has a much more accurate and longer list than most of us do.

Because of this, although fruit will be present in the life of every believer, the fruit **I** expect to find may not be.

One objection is the idea that God would not save people and then leave them without significant life change.
In a sense that’s true.
The problem comes from when we decide what is or isn’t the appropriate amount of life change.
The verses above show that God does save some people who at least at times live as carnal Christians.
A root of the objection seems to be not seeing the blood of Christ as enough to cover the sins of a carnal Christian life.
In this view, sins a person commits that are big enough are too big to be covered by the blood of Christ, but if those sins are small enough and the person’s obedience is big enough then those sins can be covered.
The Biblical view, though, is that all sins are serious enough to warrant judgment, but that the blood of Christ is valuable enough to cover all sins.
Luther writes:

> First, a person must realize that he is a sinner, the kind of a sinner who is congenitally unable to do any good thing.
> "Whatsoever is not of faith, is sin.”
> Those who seek to earn the grace of God by their own efforts are trying to please God with sins.

And again:

> When you hear that such an enormous price was paid for you, will you still come along with your cowl, your shaven pate, your chastity, your obedience, your poverty, your works, your merits?
> What do you want with all these trappings?
> What good are the works of all men, and all the pains of the martyrs, in comparison with the pains of the Son of God dying on the Cross, so that there was not a drop of His precious blood, but it was all shed for your sins.
> If you could properly evaluate this incomparable price, you would throw all your ceremonies, vows, works, and merits into the ash can.
> What awful presumption to imagine that there is any work good enough to pacify God, when to pacify God required the invaluable price of the death and blood of His own and only Son?

As a result of this perspective, the verses about carnal Christians can be read in a straightforward way without needing to find a way to reinterpret them.

## The Kind of Faith That Produces Works
In addition to the Biblical evidence against the "faith-then" view, it suffers from internal contradictions as well.

If I believe in Jesus but my life doesn’t show significant fruit, how would someone with the "faith-then" view diagnose the problem?
Remember that we are talking here not about the view that repentance is a second requirement to faith, nor the view that repentance is an inherent part of faith—objections to those views have been addressed above.
In this view, the faith that is necessary is simply trusting Jesus for salvation.
So what if I have done that and yet my life doesn’t exhibit significant fruit?

The person who holds this view is left with few options but to insist that I don’t in fact have that kind of faith after all: I am either mistaken or lying.
That’s little help for me, though, if I do in fact have that kind of faith.

What if I myself hold the "faith-then" view but I find that I don’t have enough fruit despite my faith?
I have a few possible responses:

First, I might decide that my faith didn’t work and that therefore the gospel is false.

Second, I might decide I need to plead with God for the kind of faith that leads to fruit, or for him to give me the fruit he’s promised in response to faith.
This is inspired partially by passages such as the parable in Luke 18:1-8 about the persistent widow.
This approach is taken by the Puritan tradition, including Jonathan Edwards and, more contemporaneously, John Piper.
There are problems with this view of God: it conceives of God as an unjust judge, as in the parable, who needs to be pled with before he will do what is right.
Also, this contradicts the view that God always grants works to those who believe: instead, it says that God grants works to those who believe *and* plead with him.
From this, you could conclude that if you don’t have works you might very well be saved, you just haven’t pled for good works enough.
But if instead this view persists in saying that you *must* have that fruit or else you aren’t saved, this makes pleading with God an additional requirement for salvation.

Third, I might decide that what I need is not to pray, but instead to choose to work.
In this view, everyone who is regenerated will work, and if I find myself able to choose to work I should do so.
But this view is in reality making works a condition of salvation. Those who hold this view will often deny this, and most of them genuinely don't *intend* to make works a condition of salvation.
That is still the effect of their teachings, however.
Good works are a thing you must do, or else you are not saved—that’s a condition of salvation.
It doesn’t matter that those works don’t need to be present in the first moment of faith, when this view still claims that justification happens—salvation is still conditional on doing these works.

## Reinterpretation
The evidence of Bible passages that say “you are saved, therefore obey” is a significant argument against the "faith-then" view that its proponents must handle.

One approach they take is to interpret them to mean “you are saved; therefore obey, or else you were never really saved.”
Adding the “or else you were never really saved” to passages that don’t contain it is a problem, but it’s not the only one.

Another problem is a logical contradiction: this statement asserts positively that you *are* saved, but nonetheless admits the possibility that you might *not* be saved.
This contradiction can spread throughout all the theology and teaching of someone with such a view: at times they can affirm that they and others can have confidence that they are saved, and at other times they will affirm that at any point a sufficient lack of fruit can prove that they or anyone were never really saved.

Some who teach this might actually mean “you *claim* you are saved, so obey, or else you were never really saved.”
But this is to completely change the meaning of the passage.
Instead of an affirmation that the person is saved, with an injunction to obey on the basis of that, instead we have moved the assurance entirely to the other side of the command, and we are questioning the person’s salvation instead of affirming it.
Once such a principle of interpretation is permitted, it can be applied it to any number of other passages to make them suit one's theological preconceptions.
