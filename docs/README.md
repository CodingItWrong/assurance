# Assurance

There is a view on Christian assurance of salvation that says “even though you’ve believed in Jesus, if you aren’t producing fruit, it shows that you were never really saved.” How exactly can this be? There are a range of different views that people who say this will take. Each of them runs into problems Biblically, and, to attempt to prevent this, supporters will take leaps that have logical problems as well.

I’ve seen four different sub-views of this view. The differences between them are subtle, but important.

## Faith-Plus
The “faith-plus” view says that there is a requirement for justification in addition to faith: repentance, or submission to Christ’s Lordship. In the last few decades this is most promoted by John MacArthur’s Lordship Salvation movement.

It’s difficult to understand how the “faith-plus” view can claim to hold to “justification by faith alone.” In no sense is faith alone: it must be accompanied by a second thing (in this view), submission to Christ’s Lordship or repentance. As a result, this view can’t address the many verses that describe faith or belief as the only requirement for salvation.

## Faith-Including
The “faith-including" view says that faith is indeed the one and only requirement for justification, but a certain kind of faith: a faith that includes repentance or obedience. The view is very similar to “faith-plus,” but because of how it thinks about faith, it avoids the problem of the “faith-plus” view of adding a second requirement for justification in addition to faith.

One argument against this view is that the verses that only mention faith as the requirement of salvation also don’t include in the context the idea that that faith entails repentance and submission to Christ’s Lordship. One verse that makes this especially clear is Romans 4:4-5 — “Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.” In this verse, far from allowing work to be part of true faith, work is contrasted with faith. If you work at all, you aren’t receiving a gift but a wage. The faith that justifies is a faith that excludes works. There is no way to interpret it to mean “To the one who does not work, but believes with a faith that includes a commitment to work.”

## Faith-Then
A third view avoids the problems of the first view by clarifying that the faith that justifies really is only belief in Christ apart from any commitments to work. The fruit that is necessary for assurance comes strictly later. God guarantees that any believer will produce that fruit, but it’s not something we add to our faith. Because of this, on the surface there are no problems with this view as it relates to justification by faith alone.

What exactly the standard of fruit is isn’t clear, however. Few who take this view would argue that Christians always bear fruit perfectly (never sin), so what sin is allowed before justification is brought into question? Is it only some “larger” or “more serious” sins? Is it recurring sins rather than one-time? Is it only “intentional” sins? Scripture doesn’t provide a clear answer, so proponents of this view are left to make their own decision about what is or isn’t allowed.

Whatever decision is made about how serious the sin is, there are Bible verses that describe Christians who have significant struggles with sin. In Romans 7, Paul describes how his desire to do good wars with sin within him that makes him desire to do evil. In a Reformed view that I and the advocates of fruit-as-evidence share, this passage can’t refer to Paul in his unsaved state, because unregenerate people don’t desire to do good. In Paul, 1 Corinthians 3 addresses an audience he clearly says are saved (“brethren,” “in Christ”), yet are described as being fleshly/carnal. They are characterized by a lifestyle of not producing fruit, yet they are still saved.

Both in 1 Corinthians 3 and in other passages, writers of the epistles encourage Christians to choose to obey God. This is presented as a real choice where the opposite is a possibility. But if Christians can choose to obey God or not, then Christians don’t necessarily consistently obey.

In fact, this is a key part of Paul’s epistle structure: he usually lays out Christian doctrine, then states that because all those things are true of the readers, therefore they should obey. Obedience is not a condition of assurance, but instead assurance is the basis and motivation for obedience. We obey not so we know that we’re Christians, but instead because we already know that we are.

It’s important to acknowledge that the Bible does in fact state that all Christians will produce fruit. Martin Luther and Charles Ryrie, both of whom are strong opponents of the idea of basing your assurance on fruit, nonetheless acknowledge the Biblical teaching that all Christians will produce fruit. How can this come together? Because the fruit isn’t intended to be something we are guaranteed to be able to see or identify. Ryrie writes that our human lists of what constitutes fruit are biased and incomplete, as well as the fact that the existence of fruit doesn’t mean the fruit is necessarily visible to all.

**STUFF ABOUT PREDESTINATION HERE**

One objection is the idea that God would not save people and then leave them without significant life change. In a sense that’s true. The problem comes from when we decide what is or isn’t the appropriate amount of life change. The verses above show that God does save some people who at least at times live as carnal Christians. A root of the objection seems to be not seeing the blood of Christ as enough to cover the sins of a carnal Christian life. In this view, sins a person commits that are big enough are too big to be covered by the blood of Christ, but if those sins are small enough and the person’s obedience is big enough then those sins can be covered. The Biblical view, though, is that all sins are serious enough to warrant judgment, but that the blood of Christ is valuable enough to cover all sins. As a result of this perspective, the verses about carnal Christians can be read in a straightforward way without needing to find a way to reinterpret them.

## The Kind of Faith That Produces Works
If someone takes the faith-then view and persists in it despite the Biblical evidence that regenerated people can lack significant fruit at times, there are internal contradictions with the view as well.

If I believe in Jesus but my life doesn’t show significant fruit, how would someone with this view diagnose the problem? Remember that we are talking here not about the view that repentance is a second requirement to faith, nor the view that repentance is an inherent part of faith—objections to those views have been addressed elsewhere. In this view, the faith that is necessary is simply trusting Jesus for salvation. So what if I have done that and yet my life doesn’t exhibit significant fruit?

The person who holds this view is left with few options but to insist that I don’t in fact have that kind of faith after all: I am either mistaken or lying. That’s little help for me, though, if I do in fact have that kind of faith.

What if I myself hold this view but I find that I don’t have enough fruit despite my faith? I might decide that my faith didn’t work and that therefore the gospel is false.

Alternatively, I might decide I need to plead with God for the kind of faith that leads to fruit, or for him to give me the fruit he’s promised in response to faith. This is inspired partially by passages such as the parable in Luke about the persistent widow. This approach is taken by the Puritan tradition, including Jonathan Edwards and, more contemporaneously, John Piper. There are problems with this view of God: it conceives of God as an unjust judge, as in the parable, who needs to be pled with before he will do what is right. Also, this contradicts the view that God always grants works to those who believe: instead, it says that God grants works to those who believe *and* plead with him. From this, you could conclude that if you don’t have works you might very well be saved, you just haven’t pled for good works enough. But if instead this view persists in saying that you *must* have that fruit or else you aren’t saved, this makes pleading with God an additional requirement for salvation.

Alternatively, I might decide that what I need is not to pray, but instead to choose to work. In this view, everyone who is regenerated will work, and if I find myself able to choose to work I should do so. But this view is in reality making works a condition of salvation. Those who hold this view will deny this, and most of them genuinely don't *intend* to make works a condition of salvation. That is still the effect of what they're doing, however. Good works are a thing you must do, or else you are not saved—that’s a condition of salvation. It doesn’t matter that those works don’t need to be present in the first moment of faith, when this view still claims that justification happens—these works are still a condition of salvation.

## Reinterpretation
The evidence of Bible passages that say “you are saved, therefore obey” is a significant argument against this view that they must handle.

One approach they take is to interpret them to mean “you are saved; therefore obey, or else you were never really saved.” Adding the “or else you were never really saved” to passages that don’t contain it is a problem, but it’s not the only one.

Another problem is the logical contradiction in the statement: if you are saved, there is nothing that can prove you were never really saved. This contradiction can spread throughout all the theology and teaching of someone with such a view: at times they can affirm that they and others can have confidence that they are saved, and at other times they will affirm that at any point a sufficient lack of fruit can prove that they or anyone were never really saved.

Some who teach this might actually mean “you *claim* you are saved, so obey, or else you were never really saved.” But this is to completely change the meaning of the passage. Instead of an affirmation that the person is saved, with an injunction to obey on the basis of that, instead we have moved the assurance entirely to the other side of the command, and we are questioning the person’s salvation instead of affirming it.

Once such a principle of interpretation is permitted, it’s very easy to apply it to any number of other passages to make them suit your theological preconceptions.
