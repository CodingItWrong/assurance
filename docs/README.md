# Assurance

Justification is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone. And we can have complete certainty that we are saved on the basis of that faith.

## Belief the Only Condition
Many Bible verses about salvation explicitly list belief as the only condition of salvation.

> But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God
> (John 1:12)

> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.
> (John 3:16)

> Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life.
> He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.
> (John 5:24)

> For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.
> ( John 6:40)

> Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. (John 6:47)

> Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life.
> Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.
> Do you believe this?”
> (John 11:25-26)

Zane Hodges points out that the book of John is the only explicitly evangelistic book in the New Testament, and so it's significant how clear it is that belief is the only requirement of salvation.

> Then he brought them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”
> And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”
> (Acts 16:30-31, ESV)

> But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe.
> For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. (Rom 3:21-25)

> For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law. (Romans 3:28)

> We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners; yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.
> (Gal 2:15-16)

> For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, (Eph 2:8)

> Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him.
> (1 John 5:1, ESV)

These verses don’t fall victim to the “argument from silence” fallacy, because they positively state that if you believe, you are saved. If someone believes, and they are not saved because they are lacking some other condition, then these verses are false.

Romans 4:4-5 goes even further, explicitly stating that works are excluded from faith:

> Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due.
> But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.

## The Gospel Teaches Assurance
The gospel is that Jesus died to pay the penalty for sin so that everyone who trusts him for salvation is in fact saved. To believe the gospel is to believe that everyone who trusts in Jesus is saved, and therefore to believe that I (the one trusting) am saved.

If, instead, I trust in Jesus but I think I might not be saved, then I must not believe that everyone who trusts in Jesus for salvation is in fact saved. But that is to disbelieve the gospel.

Zane Hodges writes:

> to doubt the guarantee of eternal life is to doubt the message itself. In short, if I do not believe that I am saved, I do not believe the offer the God has made to me.

and

> to believe the Biblical promises about eternal life is to believe that one has eternal life. If one does not believe that he or she has eternal life, one does not believe the promises, since the promises assure believers that we do.

This is not to criticize those who are struggling with doubt. Instead, it is to say that to encourage people not to find assurance based on their faith is to encourage them to disbelieve the gospel.

## Assurance as Motivation
Assurance is a key part of Paul’s epistle structure: he usually lays out Christian doctrine, then states that because all those things are true of the readers, therefore they should obey. Obedience is not a condition of assurance, but instead assurance is the basis and motivation for obedience. We obey not so we know that we’re Christians, but instead because we already know that we are.

## Sin is Possible
God’s intent for believers is to obey him and live a holy life. But this doesn’t mean obedience is an additional condition for salvation in addition to faith, or that a certain level of obedience is guaranteed for everyone who believes.

Both in 1 Corinthians 3 and in other passages, writers of the epistles encourage Christians to choose to obey God.
This is presented as a genuine choice, where choosing *not* to obey is a real possibility.
But if Christians can choose to obey God or not, then Christians don’t necessarily consistently obey.

In Romans 7, Paul describes how his desire to do good wars with sin within him that makes him desire to do evil.
This passage can’t refer to Paul in his unsaved state, because unregenerate people don’t desire to do good.

In 1 Corinthians 3, Paul addresses an audience he clearly says are saved (“brethren,” “in Christ”), yet are described as being fleshly/carnal (emphasis mine):

> And I, *brethren*, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants *in Christ*.
> I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it.
> Indeed, even now you are not yet able, for you are still *fleshly*.
> For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not *fleshly*, and are you not walking like mere men?

Paul's audience is characterized by a lifestyle of not producing fruit, yet they are still saved.
