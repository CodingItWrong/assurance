# Martin Luther

Martin Luther is sometimes misunderstood to have been opposing only justification by works.
If this is the case, then his teachings would be compatible with the idea that justifying faith must include obedience, or that works follow justification as proof that you are saved.

But in his *Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians* Luther clarifies that he opposes works being connected to justification in more ways than just justification by works.
In doing so, he lays a deep foundation for the meaning of faith and the gospel that can prepare us to resist any kind of intrusion of works.

Quotations in this article come from [Theodore Graebner's translation](https://books.apple.com/us/book/commentary-on-the-epistle-to-the-galatians/id498662294).

## Separating Faith and Works

Luther teaches that works and the Law should not come into faith or assurance at all.

> When it come [sic] to the article of justification we must not yield, if we want to retain the truth of the Gospel.
>
> When the conscience is disturbed, do not seek advice from reason or from the Law, but rest your conscience in the grace of God and in His Word, and proceed as if you had never heard of the Law.
> The Law has its place and its own good time.

On the topic of the conscience being disturbed about its assurance of justification, Luther says that the Law and works should not come into it in the least.
Luther considers this of primary importance: assurance in this way is part of "the article of justification" and essential "to retain the truth of the Gospel."

> To divide Law and Gospel means to place the Gospel in heaven, and to keep the Law on earth; to call the righteousness of the Gospel heavenly, and the righteousness of the Law earthly; to put as much difference between the righteousness of the Gospel and that of the Law, as there is difference between day and night.
> If it is a question of faith or conscience, ignore the Law entirely.
> If it is a question of works, then lift high the lantern of works and the righteousness of the Law.

Luther does not accept a subtle view that claims that justification is not by good works, and yet carefully crafts distinctions so that good works are nonetheless included as an essential requirement of justification.
To the contrary, his view is "to put as much difference between the righteousness of the Gospel and that of the Law, as there is a difference between day and night."
For questions of faith (what do I believe to be justified) and conscience (how can I be assured I'm justified), the Law should be ignored entirely.

> Now we are dealing with justification, and here good works should not be so much as mentioned.

This is a far cry from views that teach that good works must be emphasized and required as an essential part of saving faith.
And, as we have seen above, when Luther talks about justification he closely associates it with how to assure your conscience that you really are justified.
In the area of assuring your conscience as well, good works should not be mentioned.

## Not Adding Works to Faith

The above should make it clear that Luther teaches works have no role in justification whatsoever.
More specifically, he also clarifies that he is not just opposing works *instead* of faith, but also works *added to* faith:

> The heart of man finds it difficult to believe that so great a treasure as the Holy Ghost is gotten by the mere hearing of faith.
> The hearer likes to reason like this: Forgiveness of sins, deliverance from death, the gift of the Holy Ghost, everlasting life are grand things.
> If you want to obtain these priceless benefits, you must engage in correspondingly great efforts.
> And the devil says, "Amen."

> Now the true Gospel has it that we are justified by faith alone, without the deeds of the Law.
> The false gospel has it that we are justified by faith, but not without the deeds of the Law.
> The false apostles preached a conditional gospel.
>
> So do the papists.
> They admit that faith is the foundation of salvation.
> But they add the conditional clause that faith can save only when it is furnished with good works.
> This is wrong.

> For this is Antichrist's doctrine: Faith is no good, unless it is reinforced by works.

## Works Marked by Sin

So works are not *required* to be added to faith, but can it be beneficial to add them to our faith for the sake of our justification?
No, because our works contribute nothing positive, because they consist of sin:

> To reject the grace of God is a common sin, of which everybody is guilty who sees any righteousness in himself or in his deeds.

> First, a person must realize that he is a sinner, the kind of a sinner who is congenitally unable to do any good thing.
> "Whatsoever is not of faith, is sin.”
> Those who seek to earn the grace of God by their own efforts are trying to please God with sins.

> When you hear that such an enormous price was paid for you, will you still come along with your cowl, your shaven pate, your chastity, your obedience, your poverty, your works, your merits?
> What do you want with all these trappings?
> What good are the works of all men, and all the pains of the martyrs, in comparison with the pains of the Son of God dying on the Cross, so that there was not a drop of His precious blood, but it was all shed for your sins.
> If you could properly evaluate this incomparable price, you would throw all your ceremonies, vows, works, and merits into the ash can.
> What awful presumption to imagine that there is any work good enough to pacify God, when to pacify God required the invaluable price of the death and blood of His own and only Son?

## Dead to the Law

So all of our works are marked by sin and can't justify us.
But surely God would not accept people who don't obey the Law? To the contrary, believers have been delivered from the Law and are dead to it:

> The scholastics think that the judicial and ceremonial laws of Moses were abolished by the coming of Christ, but not the moral law.
> They are blind.
> When Paul declares that we are delivered from the curse of the Law he means the whole Law, particularly the moral law which more than the other laws accuses, curses, and condemns the conscience.

> How can the Law effect our justification, when Paul so plainly states that we must be dead to the Law if we want to live unto God?
> If we are dead to the Law and the Law is dead to us, how can it possibly contribute anything to our justification?
> There is nothing left for us but to be justified by faith alone.

> On first sight Paul seems to be advancing a strange and ugly heresy.
> He says, "I am dead to the law, that I might live unto God."
> The false apostles said the very opposite.
> They said, “If you do not live to the law, you are dead unto God."
>
> The doctrine of our opponents is similar to that of the false apostles in Paul's day.
> Our opponents teach, "If you want to live unto God, you must live after the Law, for it is written, Do this and thou shalt live."
> Paul, on the other hand, teaches, "We cannot live unto God unless we are dead unto the Law."
> If we are dead unto the Law, the Law can have no power over us.

Not only is living for the Law not required by God, just the opposite: it is impossible to live for God unless we are first dead to the Law.

## Assurance

All of this establishes that the only requirement for salvation is faith in Christ, a faith that doesn't include works.
This provides a firm ground for assurance of salvation.
Luther makes this explicit, that we can be assured of our salvation:

> The Roman theologians teach that no man can know for a certainty whether he stands in the favor of God or not.
> This teaching forms one of the chief articles of their faith.
> With this teaching they tormented men's consciences, excommunicated Christ from the Church, and limited the operations of the Holy Ghost.
> St. Augustine observed that "every man is certain of his faith, if he has faith."
> This the Romanists deny.
> "God forbid," they exclaim piously, "that I should ever be so arrogant as to think that I stand in grace, that I am holy, or that I have the Holy Ghost."
> We ought to feel sure that we stand in the grace of God, not in view of our own worthiness, but through the good services of Christ.
> As certain as we are that Christ pleases God, so sure ought we to be that we also please God, because Christ is in us.
> And although we daily offend God by our sins, yet as often as we sin, God's mercy bends over us.
> Therefore sin cannot get us to doubt the grace of God.
> Our certainty is of Christ, that mighty Hero who overcame the Law, sin, death, and all evils.
> So long as He sits at the right hand of God to intercede for us, we have nothing to fear from the anger of God.
