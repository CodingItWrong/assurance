# Why It Matters

Why does it matter whether we believe that assurance comes from faith alone, or from our works? If someone gets this wrong, what's the problem?

- **Can lead to not being saved:** if you have never trusted in Christ alone for your salvation, and instead have only trusted in your own obedience as contributing to your salvation, you haven’t trusted in Christ and you aren’t saved.
- **Small view of grace:** if Christ’s sacrifice only covers the smaller kinds of sins and not bigger ones, the worth of his blood is limited.
- **Small view of sin and large view of our righteousness:** because everyone sins, this view says that some kinds of sin are big enough that God can’t accept them, but smaller sins are fine. When we only commit smaller sins, our obedience makes us acceptable to God.
- **Viewing ourselves as better than others:** when we see our sins as small and others' sins as large, we think of ourselves as more acceptable to God. We are like the Pharisee in the parable who thanks God he is better than other people.
- **Slavery to the Law:** if you need to constantly focus on your obedience or you risk being rejected by God, then you aren’t interacting with God as a friend or Father, but as a slave.
- **You can never know if you're saved:** no matter how much evidence you have right now that you’re saved, if it’s possible that later you could lack fruit and prove you were never saved, then you don’t know if you’re saved right now. You can't rely on any promise of God for his children, because you might not be one of them, so none of those promises would apply to you.
- **Downward spiral of fear:** if the more you sin the less confidence you have that you’re saved, then the more you struggle the less help you have from God.
